# About the app

A user interface where users can upload photos to create album memories using AI, especially related to the first months of their children.

How it works:

- user uploads photos: allow multiple uploads up to 10 photos, each one with a maximum of 5 MB
- process the uploaded photos using AI
- display the uploaded photos in the app and allow to tag the members of the family
- The main charather/person will be the child/new born
- Make the AI tell the story as a memory book
